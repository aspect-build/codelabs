# Bazel Codelab

This codelab is part of the Bazel Training course from [Aspect.dev](https://aspect.dev).

You can self-study by following our [Tutorial](https://docs.aspect.build/tutorial).
However, we recommend signing up for an instructor-led class at <https://aspect.dev/services#training>.

This is the `dependencies` branch, where Bazel can fetch external dependencies.
The next step is for product engineers to add Bazel packages, marked by `BUILD.bazel` files.
You can skip to the `packages` branch to see the solution to this step.
