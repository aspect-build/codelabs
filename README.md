# Bazel Codelab

This codelab is part of the Bazel Training course from [Aspect.dev](https://aspect.dev).

You can self-study by following our [Tutorial](https://docs.aspect.build/tutorial).
However, we recommend signing up for an instructor-led class at <https://aspect.dev/services#training>.

This is the `start` branch, with a bare monorepo, no Bazel setup yet.
The first step for a Bazel DevInfra team is to fetch external dependencies.
You can skip to the `dependencies` branch to see the solution for this step.
