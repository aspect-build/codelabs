# Bazel Codelab

This codelab is part of the Bazel Training course from [Aspect.dev](https://aspect.dev).

You can self-study by following our [Tutorial](https://docs.aspect.build/tutorial).
However, we recommend signing up for an instructor-led class at <https://aspect.dev/services#training>.

This is the `packages` branch.
It can be built and tested by Bazel.
The next step for a DevInfra team is to hook up workflows like CI, linting, etc.
See the `final` branch for the solution to this step.
